How to use
------------
 
There are several ways to use the Banana Framework

1. Working with dependency list
Banana uses google closure to build compiled JavaScript files. 
It calculate orderings of script files in dependency order.  
This makes working in large projects a lot easier since all components are
seperated in different files. During development and testing js files
are loaded on the fly. For production usages you create a minified version of the
framework + your files.
To build you need GNU make. 


2. Another way is to just use the minified application.min.js in a new or existing project. 
The minified version got all functionalities of the Banana framework.
